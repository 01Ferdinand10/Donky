# Donkey Kong 2.0
The game is my final project for Advanced Programming. It is a recreation of the classic "Donkey Kong" game, which many people used to play. The project includes three levels, a menu, a scoreboard, and information about the items in the game.

Remember: 
Play close attention to where you save the classes and to reference them well.
